Both AlbumSort and AlbumSortQuick both use Java Netbeans IDE 8.2. AlbumSortQuick has no other classes it uses.
AlbumSortQuick can be compiled without incorperating any other classes to it. AlbumSort uses the picture class 
to create a more indepth data collection. Instead of just reading from the website, AlbumSort actually collects 
the information, and stores it in a easy to read array list. For AlbumSort to compile, it will need the picture
class with it.
